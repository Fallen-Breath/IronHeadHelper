# IronHeadHelper

Hello World Java!

Nah, for the usage, input 3 intergers of the position of the piston and it will output the position you should put the powersource.

What to do? The simplest 13+ bedrock breaking method stuff ofc.

It's quite raw tbh. But it'a a helloworld! \o/



# How to use

1. Input the coordinate of the piston you want to place
2. Place the piston and the power source according to the result
3. ignite a TNT and make sure the TNT can destroy the piston and the power source
4. Spaming right clicks to place a new piston at the position of the existing piston, in the direction you want.
5. Enjoy powerful IronHead bedrock breaking \o/
